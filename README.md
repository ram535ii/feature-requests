Request new features and check our roadmap for the next few months

## Roadmap

You can check our roadmap for the next few months here: [Roadmap](https://github.com/graphcool/feature-requests/projects/1)

## +1 a feature request

If an existing feature request is very important for you, please go ahead and :+1: it or leave a comment. We're always open to reprioritize our roadmap to make sure you're having the best possible UX.

## Requesting a new feature

We love your ideas for new features. If you're missing a certain feature, please feel free to [request a new feature here](https://github.com/graphcool/feature-requests/issues/new). (Please make sure to check first if somebody else already requested it.)
